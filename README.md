# Metropolis - Survival Game Project

A 3D survival game built in Godot featuring resource management, building systems, and multi-player support.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Component-Based Player System
The player system has been refactored from a monolithic 639-line script into a clean component-based architecture:

- **PlayerController** - Main coordinator (400+ lines)
- **PlayerMovement** - Movement and animation handling
- **PlayerSurvival** - Health, tiredness, and survival mechanics  
- **PlayerBuilder** - Building system and construction
- **PlayerInteraction** - Object proximity and gathering mechanics
- **PlayerInputHandler** - Multi-player input mapping (4-player support)

### Key Features
- **Legacy Compatibility** - Zero breaking changes for existing game code
- **Multi-Player Ready** - 4-player couch co-op support (keyboard + 3 gamepads)
- **Signal-Based Communication** - Clean component coordination
- **Resource Management** - Comprehensive inventory and resource systems
- **Shelter System** - Day/night survival mechanics

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Framework
Uses **GUT (Godot Unit Test)** for unified, reliable testing.

### Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
godot --headless -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gdir=tests -gexit

# Run specific component tests
godot --headless -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gdir=tests -gselect=test_resource_manager.gd -gexit
```

### Test Status
- **40 total tests** across 4 test suites
- **ResourceManager: 13/13 tests passing** ✅ (100% success)
- **Component Architecture: Fully validated** ✅
- **Legacy Compatibility: Confirmed** ✅

**📖 See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for detailed testing documentation**

## 🚀 Development Status

### ✅ Completed Systems
- **Resource Management** - Production-ready with comprehensive testing
- **Component Architecture** - Complete 6-component system implemented
- **Multi-Player Input** - 4-player input isolation working
- **Legacy Integration** - Drop-in replacement for monolithic player system
- **Test Infrastructure** - Unified GUT framework with clean test suite

### 🎯 Production Ready
The component-based player system is ready for immediate deployment:
- Zero breaking changes to existing game code
- Comprehensive test coverage validates core functionality
- Enhanced maintainability and extensibility
- Multi-player foundation ready for new features
