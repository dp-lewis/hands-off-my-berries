# Thirst Meter Implementation

## Overview
Added a comprehensive thirst meter system to complement the existing health, hunger, and tiredness survival mechanics. The thirst system follows the same patterns and architecture as the existing survival stats.

## Implementation Details

### PlayerSurvival Component Changes
Added thirst tracking to the core survival component with proper integration:

**New Variables:**
- `thirst: float = 100.0` - Current thirst level
- `max_thirst: float = 100.0` - Maximum thirst capacity  
- `thirst_log_timer: float = 0.0` - Logging timer to prevent spam

**New Configuration:**
- `thirst_decrease_rate: float = 3.0` - Thirst lost per minute (faster than hunger)
- `water_thirst_restore: float = 40.0` - How much thirst water will restore (for future implementation)

**New Functions:**
- `handle_thirst_system(delta)` - Main thirst processing (decrease over time, dehydration damage)
- `get_thirst()` / `get_thirst_percentage()` / `get_max_thirst()` - Getter functions for UI
- `is_dehydrated()` - Check if player has zero thirst

**New Signals:**
- `thirst_changed(new_thirst, max_thirst)` - For UI updates
- `started_dehydration` / `stopped_dehydration` - Status change notifications

### UI Integration
Updated all three UI variants to display the thirst meter:

**Main Player UI (`ui/player_ui.tscn` + `ui/player_ui.gd`):**
- Added ThirstContainer with water drop emoji (üíß) and progress bar
- Positioned between hunger and tiredness for logical grouping
- Blue color coding (blue ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí red based on thirst level)
- Integrated with existing UI update cycles

**Simple Player UI (`ui/simple_player_ui.gd`):**
- Added thirst display to text-based stats
- Shows "Thirst: X" in the status text

**Modular Player UI (`ui/components/modular_player_ui.gd`):**
- Added thirst display between hunger and tiredness
- Uses same progress bar styling as other stats
- Integrated with color-coded visual feedback

### Player Controller Integration
Added thirst compatibility functions to `scenes/players/player.gd`:
- `get_thirst()` - Returns current thirst level
- `get_thirst_percentage()` - Returns thirst as 0.0-1.0 percentage

### Thirst Mechanics
**Decrease Rate:**
- Thirst decreases at 3.0 per minute (faster than hunger's 2.0)
- This creates pressure to find water sources regularly

**Dehydration Effects:**
- When thirst reaches 0, player takes health damage
- Same damage rate as starvation (configurable)
- Dehydration status signals for potential future features

**Respawn Behavior:**
- Thirst resets to maximum when player respawns
- Consistent with other survival stats

## Future Water System Integration
The thirst system is designed for easy integration with a future water system:

**Ready for Water Sources:**
- `water_thirst_restore` configuration already defined
- Signal system ready for water consumption events
- UI already displays thirst status for player awareness

**Potential Water Features:**
- Water collection from rivers/lakes/wells
- Water purification mechanics
- Water bottles as inventory items
- Rain collection systems

## Design Philosophy
The thirst meter follows established patterns:
- **Consistent Architecture:** Same structure as hunger/tiredness systems
- **UI Integration:** Fits naturally into existing meter displays  
- **Visual Clarity:** Water drop emoji and blue theming
- **Balanced Pressure:** Faster decrease than hunger but manageable
- **Future-Ready:** Prepared for water source implementation

## Files Modified
- `components/player_survival.gd` - Added thirst system core
- `scenes/players/player.gd` - Added thirst compatibility functions
- `ui/player_ui.tscn` - Added thirst UI container and bar
- `ui/player_ui.gd` - Added thirst meter updates and color coding
- `ui/simple_player_ui.gd` - Added thirst to text display
- `ui/components/modular_player_ui.gd` - Added thirst to modular UI

## Testing Status
- ‚úÖ Compiles without errors
- ‚úÖ UI elements properly declared and referenced
- ‚úÖ Thirst processing integrated into main survival loop
- ‚úÖ All UI variants include thirst display
- ‚è≥ Runtime testing needed to verify thirst decreases and UI updates

The thirst meter is now fully implemented and ready for testing. When you're ready to add water sources, the foundation is already in place!
