## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```
PlayerController (CharacterBody3D)
├── PlayerMovement       - Physics, animation, character control
├── PlayerSurvival       - Health, hunger, tiredness mechanics
├── PlayerBuilder        - Build mode, construction system
├── PlayerInteraction    - Object proximity, gathering system
├── PlayerInputHandler   - Multi-player input mapping
└── ResourceManager      - Inventory and resource management
```

### Communication Patterns
- **Controller → Components**: Direct method calls for queries
- **Components → Controller**: Signal emission for state changes
- **Component → Component**: Signal-based event coordination
- **External → Controller**: Legacy compatibility method delegation
