## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Extracted from player.gd**
We successfully extracted ~200 lines of building logic:
- `handle_build_mode_input()` function (~15 lines)
- `toggle_build_mode()`, `enter_build_mode()`, `exit_build_mode()` (~30 lines)
- `create_tent_ghost()`, `make_ghost_transparent()` (~50 lines)
- `update_ghost_position()`, `place_tent_blueprint()` (~30 lines)
- `start_building_tent()`, building interaction methods (~25 lines)
- Material and mesh manipulation functions (~50 lines)

### **Enhanced Features**
The component version includes significant improvements:
- **Multi-building type support** (extensible architecture)
- **Configurable ghost system** (opacity, positioning, materials)
- **Comprehensive signal system** for UI and game state integration
- **Resource validation** before entering build mode
- **Component communication** with survival and resource systems
- **Error handling** and graceful degradation
- **Future-ready architecture** for additional building types

### **Configuration Options**
```gdscript
# Building costs
@export var tent_wood_cost: int = 8

# Tiredness costs
@export var building_tiredness_cost: float = 3.0

# Ghost preview settings
@export var ghost_forward_offset: float = 2.0
@export var ghost_opacity: float = 0.3

# Building scenes
@export var tent_scene: PackedScene
```

## 🚀 Integration Plan

### **Phase 1: Add to Player Scene**
1. Add PlayerBuilder as child node to player.tscn
2. Modify existing player.gd to use builder component when available
3. Test building behavior in actual game environment

### **Phase 2: Replace Legacy Code**
1. Remove original building functions from player.gd
2. Update _physics_process to call builder.update_ghost_preview()
3. Replace direct building access with component calls

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Building System**
1. Add multiple building types (houses, walls, towers)
2. Implement terrain validation for building placement
3. Add building upgrade and modification systems
4. Create building preview with snap-to-grid functionality

## 📁 Files Status
