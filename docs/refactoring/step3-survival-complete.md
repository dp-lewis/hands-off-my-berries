# Step 3 Survival Component - Progress Report

**Date:** August 10, 2025  
**Status:** 🎉 COMPONENT COMPLETE  
**Progress:** 100% Complete

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### **PlayerSurvival Component Created**
- ✅ **File:** `components/player_survival.gd` (310 lines)
- ✅ **Extends:** PlayerComponent base class
- ✅ **Compiles:** No syntax errors, clean implementation
- ✅ **Features:** Complete survival system with health, hunger, tiredness

### **Core Survival Features Implemented**

#### **Health System**
```gdscript
✅ Health tracking (0-100 with configurable max)
✅ Damage system with critical health warnings (<25 health)
✅ Healing system with maximum health cap
✅ Death and respawn functionality
✅ Health percentage calculations for UI
```

#### **Hunger System**
```gdscript
✅ Hunger decrease over time (configurable rate)
✅ Auto-eating when hunger drops below threshold
✅ Starvation damage when hunger reaches 0
✅ Food consumption through ResourceManager integration
✅ Hunger state change signals (started/stopped starving)
```

#### **Tiredness System**
```gdscript
✅ Base tiredness decrease over time
✅ Movement-based tiredness (integrated with PlayerMovement)
✅ Night penalty when not in shelter
✅ Shelter recovery (tent healing)
✅ Exhaustion damage when tiredness reaches 0
✅ Activity-based tiredness loss (gathering, building)
```

#### **Shelter System**
```gdscript
✅ Shelter entry/exit tracking
✅ Night protection when sheltered
✅ Tiredness recovery in shelter
✅ Shelter reference management
✅ Shelter state signals
```

#### **Day/Night Integration**
```gdscript
✅ Night penalty application
✅ Day recovery system
✅ Shelter protection during night
✅ Time-based status logging
```

### **Component Integration Features**

#### **Signal System**
```gdscript
✅ health_changed(new_health, max_health)
✅ hunger_changed(new_hunger, max_hunger)  
✅ tiredness_changed(new_tiredness, max_tiredness)
✅ player_died / shelter_entered / shelter_exited
✅ started_starving / stopped_starving
✅ started_exhaustion / stopped_exhaustion
✅ critical_health_warning
```

#### **Movement Integration**
```gdscript
✅ Connects to PlayerMovement component signals
✅ Tracks player movement for tiredness calculation
✅ Automatic movement-based tiredness loss
```

#### **Resource Integration**
```gdscript
✅ Finds and connects to ResourceManager
✅ Auto-eating consumes food resources
✅ Resource availability checking
✅ Graceful fallback when no ResourceManager
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Extracted from player.gd**
We successfully extracted ~150 lines of survival logic:
- `handle_hunger_system()` function (~35 lines)
- `handle_tiredness_system()` function (~30 lines)
- `take_damage()` and `heal()` functions (~15 lines)
- Shelter system functions (~40 lines)
- Health/hunger/tiredness getters (~20 lines)
- Configuration variables (~10 lines)

### **Enhanced Features**
The component version includes improvements over the original:
- **State change signals** for better UI integration
- **Movement integration** through component communication
- **Cleaner logging** with timer-based spam prevention
- **Better error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- **Comprehensive getters** for UI and other systems

### **Configuration Options**
```gdscript
# Hunger system
@export var hunger_decrease_rate: float = 2.0
@export var health_decrease_rate: float = 5.0  
@export var auto_eat_threshold: float = 30.0
@export var pumpkin_hunger_restore: float = 25.0

# Tiredness system
@export var base_tiredness_rate: float = 3.0
@export var walking_tiredness_rate: float = 0.3
@export var night_tiredness_penalty: float = 2.0
@export var tent_recovery_rate: float = 10.0
@export var tiredness_health_decrease_rate: float = 3.0
```

## 🧪 Testing Status

## 🚀 Integration Plan

### **Phase 1: Add to Player Scene**
1. Add PlayerSurvival as child node to player.tscn
2. Modify existing player.gd to use survival component when available
3. Test survival behavior in actual game environment

### **Phase 2: Replace Legacy Code**
1. Remove original survival functions from player.gd
2. Update _physics_process to call survival.process_survival(delta)
3. Replace direct health/hunger/tiredness access with component calls

### **Phase 3: UI Integration**
1. Connect survival signals to UI updates
2. Replace direct stat polling with signal-based updates
3. Test real-time UI responsiveness

## 📁 Files Status

### **Created Files**

✅ tests/test_player_survival.gd        (140 lines) - Comprehensive tests
🔄 Integration with existing player.gd   - Next step
```

### **Interface Compliance**
✅ Implements `interfaces/survival_interface.gd` contract  
✅ Extends `PlayerComponent` base class  
✅ Uses component lifecycle (`_on_initialize`, `_on_cleanup`)  
✅ Proper error handling and logging  
✅ Signal-based architecture for loose coupling
