# Resource Management System Refact### âœ… **Step 5: UI System Refactoring (COMPLETED)**
- Implemented signal-based reactive UI updates for resources
- Created reusable ResourceDisplay component with progress bars
- Updated both PlayerUI and SimplePlayerUI to use ResourceManager
- Separated resource updates from other stats for performance
- **Status**: Complete with reactive UI system and reusable componentsg Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to extract resource management logic from the monolithic `player.gd` script into a dedicated, reusable component system. This refactoring improves code organization, testability, and maintainability.

## Current Progress

### âœ… **Step 1: Foundation Files (COMPLETED)**
- Created ResourceManager component (`components/resource_manager.gd`)
- Created ResourceConfig system (`config/resource_config.gd`)
- Comprehensive GUT test suite (`tests/test_resource_manager.gd`)
- **Status**: Complete with 15+ test methods validating all functionality

### âœ… **Step 2: Player Integration (COMPLETED)**
- Added ResourceManager to player scene
- Updated player.gd to use ResourceManager component  
- Removed old resource variables and methods
- Updated UI system for signal-based updates
- **Status**: Complete with successful integration testing

### âœ… **Step 3: Resource Collection (COMPLETED)**
- Updated tree.gd to use ResourceManager
- Updated pumpkin.gd to use ResourceManager
- Both scripts now call `resource_manager.add_resource()` instead of direct player methods
- **Status**: Complete with all scripts compiling and integration tests passing

## Remaining Steps

### âœ… **Step 4: Update Building System (COMPLETED)**
- Updated tent.gd to use ResourceManager for wood cost validation
- Player building mode already used ResourceManager for wood checking
- Tent placement uses ResourceManager for resource deduction
- **Status**: Complete with all building operations using ResourceManager

### ï¿½ **Step 5: UI System Refactoring**  
- Consolidate resource display logic
- Implement reactive UI updates via ResourceManager signals
- Create reusable resource display components

### ðŸ”„ **Step 6: Final Testing and Polish**
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Performance validation
- Documentation updates

# Signals for reactive programming
signal resource_changed(resource_type: String, old_amount: int, new_amount: int)
signal resource_full(resource_type: String)
signal resource_empty(resource_type: String)

## Implementation Details

### ResourceManager Component Architecture
- **Dictionary-based storage**: `resources` for amounts, `capacities` for limits
- **Signal system**: `resource_changed`, `resource_full`, `resource_empty`
- **Capacity management**: Automatic overflow prevention
- **Type safety**: Resource type validation and initialization

### Configuration System
- **ResourceConfig class**: Centralized capacity definitions
- **Default configuration**: `default_resource_config.tres` with wood:10, food:5
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new resource types

### Integration Patterns
- **Component-based**: ResourceManager as child node of player
- **Signal-driven UI**: Reactive updates without tight coupling  
- **Resource collection**: Scripts use `resource_manager.add_resource(type, amount)`
- **Validation**: All operations return success/failure for proper error handling

## Benefits Achieved

âœ… **Separation of Concerns**: Resource logic isolated from player movement  
âœ… **Testability**: Comprehensive test suite with 15+ validation methods  
âœ… **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for resource management  
âœ… **Extensibility**: Adding new resources requires only config changes  
âœ… **Reusability**: ResourceManager can be used by any game entity  

## Next Steps

Focus on **Step 4: Building System** to complete the resource management integration across all game systems.
