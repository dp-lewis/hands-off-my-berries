# Metropolis Development Status - August 16, 2025

## 🎯 **Current Milestone: COMPLETED**
**Inventory & Hotbar System Integration**

---

## ✅ **What We Just Accomplished**

### **Complete Inventory System**
- **20-slot inventory** with smart item stacking and management
- **4-slot hotbar** with left/right navigation (simplified from 8 number keys)
- **Visual feedback** - highlighted selection and real-time state display
- **Multi-player ready** - isolated hotbar controls for 4 players

### **Player Experience Revolution**
- **Automatic starting items** - spawn with bucket, watering can, and 5 seeds
- **Intuitive controls** - `hud_left`/`hud_right` instead of 8 number keys
- **Immediate usability** - tools and items ready for interaction
- **Professional polish** - visual selection feedback and state management

### **Technical Excellence**
- **Zero breaking changes** - seamless integration with existing systems
- **Component architecture** - clean PlayerInventory component integration
- **Signal-driven** - proper event communication between systems
- **Production quality** - robust error handling and state management

## 🚀 **What Players Can Do Right Now**

1. **Spawn into game** → Automatically receive starting tools and seeds
2. **Navigate hotbar** → Use `hud_left`/`hud_right` to select items
3. **See selection** → Visual highlight shows active hotbar slot
4. **Use items** → Tools and consumables ready for game interactions
5. **Manage inventory** → 20 slots with smart stacking and item states

**The foundation is ready for farming mechanics!**

## 📋 **Next Development Phase: Farming Integration**

### **Immediate Goal**
Transform existing inventory/hotbar system into a complete farming experience where players can:
- **Plant seeds** from hotbar selection
- **Use tools** (hoe, watering can) for crop care
- **Harvest crops** directly into inventory
- **Create sustainable food systems** for survival

### **Technical Approach**
- **Additive development** - no changes to working inventory system
- **Component integration** - new PlayerFarming component following existing pattern
- **Leverage existing tools** - bucket, watering can, seeds already implemented
- **Signal-based communication** - farming actions trigger inventory updates

### **Documentation**
- **Full plan**: `INVENTORY_TO_FARMING_PLAN.md` - Complete roadmap and implementation strategy
- **Updated roadmap**: `TODO_NEW.md` - Reflects completed inventory milestone
